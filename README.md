# Express.js JSON Body Parsing Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when working with JSON request bodies in Express.js applications. The problem arises from an incorrect placement or configuration of the `express.json()` middleware.

## Problem Description

The provided `bug.js` file contains an Express.js application that attempts to parse a JSON request body. However, due to an improper setup of `express.json()`, the application fails to correctly access the request body's contents. This may lead to unexpected behavior, such as `req.body` remaining empty or undefined.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version of the Express.js application. It demonstrates the proper way to integrate and use `express.json()`, ensuring that the JSON request body is parsed correctly.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the directory containing `bug.js`.
3. Run the application using `node bug.js`.
4. Send a POST request to `http://localhost:3000/user` with a JSON payload in the request body.
5. Observe that `req.body` is undefined or empty in the server's console log.
6. Repeat steps 2-5 with `bugSolution.js` to see the corrected behavior.

This example highlights the importance of correctly configuring the `express.json()` middleware for successful JSON body parsing in Express.js applications.
